# Project: Weird Drawing Software

- Create **a "weird" drawing software**.
- By "weird", I mean something we haven't seen before in popular tools such as Photoshop or Illustrator, something that challenges us to look at digital drawing tools in new and different ways.
- Do not replicate what we can already do in PS, AI, etc.
- This week, you will create many small sketches. Create **at least 10 different p5js sketches**. The more the merrier. Try as many different ideas as you can. Keep them experimental. **Include screenshots/screen recordings** of your drawings for each software.
- Next week, you will share your progress with classmates, and edit/refine the p5 sketches into one drawing software.

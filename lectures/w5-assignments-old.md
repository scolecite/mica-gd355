- Watch from 7.1 to 7.6 from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bI1SlcCRfLH79HZrFAtBvX) on manipulating HTML with p5.js.

## Weird drawing software
Based on the feedback you got from the classmates, edit and refine your code and finish the project. *Bonus points: Add user interaction elements such as keypress for controlling parameters, html buttons or sliders so that users can control the drawing software. How about key mapping for multiple brush types?*

### Deliverables
- Your working code: I should be able to run it on my machine. Test before you submit. No errors.
- Five different images of the drawings created using your software. Ask people around you to try it out. You will be surprised (both in good and bad ways) at how others use it.

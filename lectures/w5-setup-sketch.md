# Setting up a p5.js sketch
different ways to setup a p5.js sketch.

## Brackets
1. First, download the p5.js complete library from http://p5js.org
1. Unzip the file.
1. Open the entire folder in Brackets.
1. Navigate to `empty-example > index.html`.
1. Now, you can live preview the `index.html`.
1. Add your own JavaScript code in `sketch.js`.
1. Anytime you save, the live preview will update.
1. If the live preview does not work, refresh the page or close the browser window and try again.

## Codepen
1. Create a new pen.
1. Click the gear icon next to JS tab.
1. Under Add External JavaScript, copy and paste the following:
  `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.5.14/p5.min.js`
1. Here, we are using externally hosted files from [CDN JS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/p5.js/).
1. Save & Close.
1. Now, start coding in the JS tab. (You don't need anything in HTML or CSS tab.)

## OpenProcessing
[OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org) does not need any setup. Just create a sketch and have fun.
